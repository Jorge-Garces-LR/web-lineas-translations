        <p>
            This pack is the perfect combination to visit Lobos Island and northern Fuerteventura.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey begins at 9:30 am from Playa Blanca port in southern Lanzarote, where the Lineas Romero fast ferry will depart towards Corralejo port, located in northern Fuerteventura.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once there, a luxury catamaran will be waiting for us to take us on the perfect adventure in the natural paradise of Lobos Island.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will sail through what we call "El RÃ­o", the arm of the sea that separates Fuerteventura from the islet by 2 km. We will have the opportunity to admire the majestic Caldera Mountain, one of the oldest volcanoes in the Canary Islands, and observe its peculiar crater from the privileged view of the boat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we will anchor near La Concha beach, known for being a paradise of turquoise waters and a natural reserve characterized by abundant marine fauna. Depending on the number of participants, we will divide into two groups of approximately 10 people each, which will later switch places.
        </p>
        <p>
            A semi-rigid boat will pick up one of the two groups and take them on a fun ride to Lobos Island port. This is where the guided walk begins to discover the magnificent crystal-clear water lagoons and the old fishing village, where we will take a photo at the famous and spectacular Puertito de Isla de Lobos.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, the other group will continue on the catamaran enjoying water activities (snorkeling, kayak, and paddle-surf) and a rich typical Spanish paella, accompanied by soft drinks, beer, and wine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the two groups have switched places, after the four-hour excursion, they will return to Corralejo. Here they will have approximately three hours to enjoy this charming town, famous for its wide culinary offer and beautiful fashion and craft shops.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nature lovers can take advantage to visit the Corralejo Dunes Natural Park and enjoy its beaches that enchant everyone who visits them.
        </p>
        <p>
            At 5:30 pm, the fast ferry will be waiting for us at Corralejo port, and in just half an hour we will be back in Lanzarote, with an experience they will remember forever.
        </p>
