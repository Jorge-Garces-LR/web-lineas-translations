            We will start the day heading to the town of Teguise, the former capital of the island, where every Sunday a bustling and traditional market is held. Here we can find various samples of crafts and typical products such as cheese and malvasia wine. Additionally, we will have free time to explore it and the possibility to enjoy the usual folk group performances that take place in the Plaza de los Leones of this town. In the historic center, we will discover emblematic buildings such as the Palacio Spínola, the church, the Santo Domingo convent, or the Timple Museum.

            We will continue our day heading north. Here we will board a modern catamaran to make the journey to La Graciosa. Once there, we can walk through Caleta de Cebo and explore the coast to Playa del Francés. We will have lunch on the boat and on our way back to Lanzarote, we will admire the impressive views of the North coast and the Famara cliff.
