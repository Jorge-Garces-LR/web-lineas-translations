            We continue our route entering the Fire Mountains, where we will have the possibility to ride a camel (optional, not included in the price). The road will take us between volcanoes and craters to visit the Timanfaya National Park, where we will enjoy the geothermal demonstrations and the famous El Diablo Restaurant. Here we will do the "Route of the Volcanoes", where we can admire the landscape that will transport us to another planet. Lunch on route (Included in the price).

            After lunch we will cross the La Geria area. This area of the island is known for its winemaking tradition. We will have the opportunity to visit one of its wineries to taste one of Lanzarote"s wines with Designation of Origin and delight in the vineyard landscape.

            From there we will head north through Teguise, the former capital of the island. From here we will cross Los Valles and Haría with a panoramic view of the Valley of the Thousand Palms. Then we will visit Los Jameos del Agua where we can see the exceptional work of the Lanzarote artist, César Manrique.
