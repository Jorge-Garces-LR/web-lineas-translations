            A bus will pick you up at the nearest point to your hotel and take you to Puerto del Carmen, the main tourist center of the island, where you will board a luxurious catamaran. A mojito and a tortilla pincho will be waiting to welcome you. We will sail south following the coast and along the beaches of Papagayo. We will anchor in an area near Punta de Papagayo.
        </p>
        <p>
            On board, you will also enjoy an exquisite freshly made paella, open bar of beer, sangria, water, and soft drinks.
        </p>
